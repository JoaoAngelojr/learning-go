# My Go Study Project

This is a repository containing my exercises and studies in Go. Each directory represents a lesson or concept I am learning in the Go language.

## Project Structure

- `1-hello/`: In this directory, you'll find the code related to my first lesson in Go, where I learned the basics and wrote a simple "Hello, World!" program, along with exercises related to learning about testing in Go, including writing unit tests and using the built-in testing tools in Go, and examples of using conditional statements in Go, such as `if` and `switch`.

## How to Run

Each directory contains one or more `.go` files related to the specific topic. To run the programs in each directory, you can use the following command:

```bash
go run <filename.go>
```

For example, to execute the "Hello, World!" program in `1-hello/`, you can use:

```bash
cd 1-hello/
go run hello.go
```
